# 24-Week Training Plan to Become a High-Level SRE

**Assumptions**:  
- You have basic programming knowledge and heavy Ansible experience.  
- Daily commitment: 2–3 hours (1 hour study, 1–2 hours practice/projects).  
- Goal: Master Python, Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible, CI/CD, Docker, observability, cloud platforms, Go, Bash, and chaos engineering, focusing on integration.  
- Structure: Combines overlapping tools (e.g., Terraform/Kubernetes, Ansible/CI/CD) for efficiency.

## Weeks 1–6: Python Foundation and Basic Automation
**Goal**: Build strong Python skills for scripting and automation, integrating basic Ansible usage.  
**Rationale**: Python is foundational for SRE tasks (e.g., scripting CI/CD, Kubernetes tools, observability). Ansible integration leverages your existing expertise.  
**Daily Routine**:  
- 1 hour: Study Python syntax, data structures, OOP, and libraries (e.g., `requests`, `os`).  
- 1–2 hours: Code 2–3 problems daily (LeetCode, HackerRank) and write Ansible playbooks with Python scripts.  
**Topics**:  
- Variables, data types, control flow, functions.  
- Lists, dictionaries, sets, comprehensions.  
- OOP (classes, inheritance), exception handling.  
- File I/O, APIs, basic Ansible module development in Python.  
**Exercises**:  
1. Write Python scripts to automate file parsing and integrate with Ansible playbooks.  
2. Solve 20 LeetCode easy problems (e.g., Two Sum).  
3. Create an Ansible playbook using a custom Python module to validate server configs.  
4. Build a Python script to query a public API and store results in a file.  
**Weekly Milestones**:  
- Week 3: Complete 30 coding problems; automate a simple task with Python+Ansible.  
- Week 6: Build a small CLI tool (e.g., log parser) with Python and Ansible integration.

## Weeks 7–10: Terraform and Infrastructure as Code
**Goal**: Master Terraform for provisioning cloud infrastructure, integrating with Python for automation.  
**Rationale**: Terraform is key for SRE infrastructure management; Python scripts enhance Terraform workflows (e.g., dynamic configs).  
**Daily Routine**:  
- 1 hour: Study Terraform HCL, providers, state management.  
- 1–2 hours: Deploy Azure resources and automate with Python scripts.  
**Topics**:  
- Terraform CLI, variables, modules, remote state.  
- Azure provider (e.g., VNets, VMs), loops, conditionals.  
- Python scripts to generate Terraform configs or validate outputs.  
**Exercises**:  
1. Deploy an Azure VNet with subnets using Terraform.  
2. Create a Terraform module for reusable resource groups.  
3. Write a Python script to parse Terraform state and update Ansible inventory.  
4. Set up remote state in Azure Blob Storage.  
**Weekly Milestones**:  
- Week 8: Deploy a complete Azure environment (VNet, VM, storage).  
- Week 10: Automate Terraform apply with a Python wrapper script.

## Weeks 11–16: Kubernetes and Docker Integration
**Goal**: Master Kubernetes and Docker, combining with Terraform and Ansible for cluster provisioning and configuration.  
**Rationale**: Kubernetes and Docker are core to SRE for containerized workloads; Terraform provisions clusters, Ansible configures them.  
**Daily Routine**:  
- 1 hour: Study Kubernetes architecture, Docker, and Helm.  
- 1–2 hours: Deploy apps on AKS, build Docker images, and automate with Ansible.  
**Topics**:  
- Kubernetes: Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress, StatefulSets, RBAC.  
- Docker: Image creation, multi-stage builds, security (e.g., Trivy).  
- Terraform: Provision AKS clusters.  
- Ansible: Configure Kubernetes nodes and deploy apps.  
- Helm: Package and deploy applications.  
**Exercises**:  
1. Use Terraform to provision an AKS cluster.  
2. Build a Docker image for a Python app and deploy to AKS.  
3. Create an Ansible playbook to install Helm and deploy a chart.  
4. Configure an Ingress for a Python app on AKS.  
5. Set up a StatefulSet with persistent storage for a database.  
**Weekly Milestones**:  
- Week 13: Deploy a Python app to AKS with Docker and Helm.  
- Week 16: Automate AKS node configuration with Ansible and Terraform.

## Weeks 17–20: CI/CD, Observability, and Cloud Platforms
**Goal**: Master CI/CD pipelines, observability, and multi-cloud management, integrating Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and Ansible.  
**Rationale**: CI/CD and observability are critical for SRE reliability; multi-cloud skills (Azure, AWS) align with real-world demands.  
**Daily Routine**:  
- 1 hour: Study GitLab CI, Prometheus/Grafana, and cloud providers.  
- 1–2 hours: Build pipelines, monitor Kubernetes, and deploy to AWS.  
**Topics**:  
- CI/CD: GitLab pipelines for Terraform, Kubernetes, and Docker.  
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, SLIs/SLOs, ELK/Loki for logging.  
- Cloud: AWS EKS, Azure AKS, cost optimization.  
- Ansible: Automate monitoring setup and pipeline tasks.  
**Exercises**:  
1. Build a GitLab CI pipeline to deploy a Dockerized app to AKS with Terraform.  
2. Deploy Prometheus/Grafana to monitor AKS pod metrics.  
3. Use Ansible to configure ELK stack for Kubernetes logs.  
4. Provision an AWS EKS cluster with Terraform and deploy a Python app.  
5. Define SLOs for a Kubernetes app (e.g., 99.9% uptime).  
**Weekly Milestones**:  
- Week 18: Complete a CI/CD pipeline for AKS deployment.  
- Week 20: Monitor a Kubernetes app with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Weeks 21–24: Go, Bash, Chaos Engineering, and Advanced SRE

**Exercises**:  
1. Write a Go tool to query Kubernetes pod status.  
2. Create a Bash script to automate Terraform validation in CI/CD.  
3. Run a Chaos Mesh experiment to simulate pod failures in AKS.  
4. Develop an Ansible playbook to deploy Chaos Mesh and run experiments.  
5. Create a runbook for a Kubernetes outage, integrating Prometheus alerts.  
**Weekly Milestones**:

## Optimization Strategies
- **Overlap**:  
  - Python scripts automate Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes tasks (e.g., parsing state, configuring clusters).  
  - Terraform provisions Kubernetes clusters; Ansible configures nodes; CI/CD deploys apps.  
  - Observability and chaos engineering integrate with Kubernetes for monitoring and resilience.  
  - Go/Bash tools enhance CI/CD and incident response workflows.  
- **Project-Based Learning**: Each week includes a mini-project combining multiple tools (e.g., Terraform+AKS+Ansible pipeline).  
- **Daily Practice**: Solve 1–2 problems or deploy 1 small project daily to reinforce integration.  
- **Portfolio**: Maintain a GitHub repo showcasing projects (e.g., AKS deployment with CI/CD, chaos experiments).  
- **Community**: Engage in r/SRE, Kubernetes Slack, and Ansible forums for feedback.  
- **Certifications**: Target Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and HashiCorp Terraform Associate by Week 24 to validate skills.

- **Weeks 1–6**: Python + Ansible (6 weeks, foundational scripting).  
- **Weeks 7–10**: Terraform + Python (4 weeks, IaC and automation).  
- **Weeks 11–16**: Kubernetes + Docker + Terraform + Ansible (6 weeks, containerization and orchestration).
